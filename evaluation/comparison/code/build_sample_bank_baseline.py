"""Fill fake carriers from an unconditional generator's sample bank.

Diffusion-TS and TimeGAN both produce fixed-length unconditional windows: they
model "what does an event of this action look like" and nothing about where on
the screen it has to land.  A generated stroke placed wherever the generator
happened to put it would miss the control the carrier targets, and the detector
would then be separating dispatch failures rather than generation quality.  So
a drawn sample is put on the carrier's row count and, for trajectories, bound
to the carrier's own endpoints by the smallest transform that can do it -- one
rotation, one uniform scale, one translation, applied to the whole path.  No
per-sample deformation, no clipping except at the screen edge.

Three details decide whether this is a fair test rather than a rigged one.

*The bank is split-disjoint.*  A bank smaller than the carrier count is reused,
and if the same generated window fell into both the detector's training fakes
and its test fakes, the detector could recognise the window itself rather than
the generator behind it.  Each split therefore draws from its own slice.

*Binding anchors on contact.*  A generated keystroke window begins and ends on
the dataset's no-touch sentinel, so its first and last rows are (0, 0) and a
chord taken from them points at the screen origin instead of along the gesture.
The chord is taken between the first and last rows where the carrier reports
contact.

*The scale is bounded, by choosing a usable sample rather than by distorting
one.*  Matching a generated chord to the carrier's chord multiplies the whole
path by their ratio, and a generated window that happens to end near where it
started needs an enormous ratio: measured on the fitted pinch bank, the ratio's
99th percentile was 14.9 and its maximum 146.5, which does not place a stroke,
it destroys one.  Guarding on chord-versus-extent alone does not catch it -- a
path that barely moves at all has a perfectly respectable chord-to-extent ratio
and still needs a huge scale.  So the bank is drawn from several times and the
draw whose required scale is closest to 1 is kept.  This is the affordance the
source method already has (it selects material on a span ladder and swaps to
another shot when a placement will not fit); denying it to the baselines would
be measuring our draw policy, not their generators.  A path is only ever scaled
uniformly, never deformed, and a draw that still needs a scale outside a sane
band degrades to translation and is counted.
