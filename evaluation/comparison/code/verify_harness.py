"""Prove the swap harness changes what it is asked to and nothing else.

Four checks, all of which have to pass before any baseline number is worth
reading:

1. **Routing is correct.**  A generator writes a fingerprint derived from the
   event's own id into its channel; the harness must land every fingerprint in
   that event's own rows.  An identity generator cannot test this -- handing
   back the slice the harness is about to overwrite is a self-assignment that
   passes whatever the offsets are -- so the payload has to depend on identity
   instead.
2. **Genuine events are untouched.**  Every built baseline dataset is compared
   against its source over the genuine rows only; any difference is a bug,
   because no baseline is allowed to alter the positive class.
3. **Fake carriers keep their shape.**  Row counts, offsets, labels, actions,
   users and the columns a baseline does not claim (contact, pressure, pointer
   count, elapsed, availability for a trajectory swap) must be identical too.
4. **The swap actually happened.**  A dataset identical to its source would pass
   every "did not change" test, so the built dataset's own count of swapped
   events is checked against the number of fake events whose claimed channel
   really differs -- and against the per-action declines it declares, since a
   declined action still carries the paper's own attack and must never be read
   as a baseline result.
