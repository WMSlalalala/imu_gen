"""Decide when a generator has finished learning, from its own samples.

Fixing a step count in advance is how the first TTS-GAN run failed: 8,000 to
30,000 iterations produced inertial signal with no sample-to-sample correlation
at all (lag-1 0.39 to 0.85 against 0.95 to 1.00 for genuine recordings), and the
FAR computed from it -- median 0.0008 -- described the budget rather than the
method.  Overshooting is the opposite failure and costs GPU days.  Neither is
acceptable when the number is going into a paper, so the budget is measured
instead of guessed.

WHAT IS MEASURED

Three statistics, chosen because they fail in different directions and are cheap
enough to evaluate at every checkpoint:

* **lag-1 autocorrelation** against the real windows.  An undertrained model
  emits noise; this is the statistic that caught the first TTS-GAN run, and a
  detector reads it directly through the per-step difference channels.
* **per-channel standard deviation ratio**.  Catches the opposite failure, a
  model collapsing onto the mean of its training set, which a lag-1 check alone
  would happily pass.
* **energy distance** between the two sets over a small feature vector.  A
  distribution-level check that neither of the first two implies, computed on
  per-window summaries rather than raw samples so it stays cheap.

Each is reported as a signed gap against the real data, and combined into one
scalar so a plateau can be defined at all.  The combination is deliberately
crude -- it decides *when to stop*, not *how good the model is*; that question
is answered afterwards, by the authors' own discriminative score against a
real-versus-real control.

WHEN IT STOPS

Training stops when the scalar gap has failed to improve on its best value by
more than `tolerance` for `patience` consecutive checkpoints, and never before
`minimum_checkpoints`.  The best checkpoint is kept, not the last, because a GAN
that has begun to diverge would otherwise be sampled at its worst.
