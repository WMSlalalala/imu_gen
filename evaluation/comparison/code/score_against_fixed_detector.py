"""Score every attack with the release's own frozen detectors.

TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, AND THIS ANSWERS THE SECOND ONE
---------------------------------------------------------
The main table trains a fresh detector against each attack.  That is the honest
per-attack number -- it asks "how well does a defender who has seen this attack
do against it" -- and it is what the source method's own pipeline does, so every
row is measured the same way.

This script asks the other question: how do the attacks fare against **the
detector the release actually shipped**, with no retraining at all?  That is the
deployed-defender view, and it is the only way to compare attacks on one fixed
decision boundary.  A generator that beats a detector trained on itself may
still be caught by a detector trained on something else, and vice versa, so the
two tables can disagree -- which is the point of reporting both.

This is inference only.  The 90 fitted models come from
`direct100k_final/detector_models/`, the FRR=5% operating points come from the
same cells' `thresholds.json` in the working tree, and neither is refitted or
re-selected here.  Nothing this script does can change a published number.

WHAT IS REUSED RATHER THAN REIMPLEMENTED
-----------------------------------------
Feature extraction, normalisation and the forward pass all come from
`security_exp.formal_event_pad` -- the same functions the release's own cells
called.  Reimplementing any of them would risk scoring the attacks through a
slightly different pipeline than the one that produced the thresholds, which
would make the comparison meaningless in a way that is very hard to see.
