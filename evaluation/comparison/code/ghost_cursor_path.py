"""ghost-cursor's pointer path, reproduced faithfully for offline use.

`ghost-cursor` (github.com/Xetera/ghost-cursor, MIT) is the most widely used
human-like pointer path generator in the browser-automation ecosystem.  Two
things distinguish it from a plain Bezier bot such as pyclick:

* the number of samples is derived from **Fitts's law** rather than requested by
  the caller, so a long move gets more frames than a short one; and
* a move longer than a threshold **overshoots the target and corrects back**,
  which is a real property of human pointing and which no single Bezier can
  produce.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A DIRECT LIBRARY CALL

The library is TypeScript and drives a browser.  `python-ghost-cursor` ports the
maths, and its `bezierCurve`, `generateBezierAnchors`, `fitts`, `clamp` and
`overshoot` are line-for-line identical to the originals -- verified against
`src/spoof.ts` and `src/math.ts`.  Two things are not, and both would silently
change what is measured:

1. **Sampling.**  The original takes `curve.getLUT(steps)`, which is spaced by
   *arc length*.  The port takes `linspace(0, 1, steps)`, which is spaced by the
   Bezier *parameter*.  On a curved path those are not the same: measured on a
   600-px arc at 12 samples, the port's step sizes run 81.9 down to 68.1 px
   (fastest 1.20x the slowest) while the original's are flat at 72.8.  Since the
   per-step distance *is* the velocity profile, and the velocity profile is what
   the detectors read, using the port here would measure a speed pattern
   ghost-cursor never produces.  Arc-length spacing is restored below.
2. **Overshoot.**  It lives in the cursor's `move`, not in `path`: over the
   threshold the library runs `path` twice, once to a point scattered around the
   target and once back to the target with a tightened spread.  Calling `path`
   alone would reduce this baseline to "pyclick with a different step formula".
   The two-segment sequence is reproduced here, following `spoof.ts:688-700`.

Everything else -- the curve, its anchors, the spread clamp, the Fitts step
count, the overshoot scatter -- is the library's own code, called unmodified.
